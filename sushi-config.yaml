# This IG YML file is inspired by the ImplementationGuide resource
# and also draws from package.json, package-list.json, and ig.ini.
# That said, it is structured for ease-of-use, so it is not strictly
# conformant to any of those existing configuration formats.

# SUSHI will use id as both id and packageId in the IG unless a
# specific packageId is also provided in this file.

description: >-
  This implementation guide defines profiles, operations and guidance for the
  use of CQL with FHIR, both as a mechanism for querying, as well as inline
  and integrated usage as part of knowledge artifacts.

# Although fhirVersions is 0..* in the ImplementationGuide resource
# it can be a single item OR and array here (but so far SUSHI only
# supports 4.0.1 anyway).
fhirVersion: 4.0.1

# The following two lines correspond to items that used to be in
# ig.ini but were moved to IG.definition.parameter. For
# consistency within this file, the names are represented using
# camelcase, but if authors use the formal parameter names, SUSHI
# will recognize them as well. In either case, they'll be copied
# to the IG JSON using the formal names.

# The publisher can be a single item or a list, each with a name and
# optional url and/or email. The first publisher's name will be used
# as IG.publisher.  The contact details and/or additional publishers
# will be translated into IG.contact values.

# The dependencies property corresponds to IG.dependsOn. The key is the

# use cases, the value can be an object with keys for `uri` and `version`.
# For R5 ImplementationGuides, the object can also have a key for `reason`.

# The resources property corresponds to IG.definition.resource.
# SUSHI can auto-generate all of the resource entries based on
# the FSH definitions and/or information in any user-provided
# JSON or XML resource files. If the generated entries are not
# sufficient or complete, however, the author can add entries
# here. If the reference matches a generated entry, it will
# replace the generated entry. If it doesn't match any generated
# entries, it will be added to the generated entries. The format
# follows IG.definition.resource with the following differences:
#   * use IG.definition.resource.reference.reference as the YAML key.
#   * if the key is an id or name, SUSHI will replace it with the
#     correct URL when generating the IG JSON.
#   * specify "omit" to omit a FSH-generated resource from the
#     resource list.
#   * if the exampleCanonical is an id or name, SUSHI will replace
#     it with the correct canonical when generating the IG JSON.
#   * groupingId can be used, but top-level groups syntax may be a
#     better option (see below).
# The following are simple examples to demonstrate what this might
# look like:
#
# resources:
  # ImplementationGuide/hl7.fhir.uv.cpg.chf: omit #omit this because this template does not generate HTML for IG, so the link from TOC fails
#   Patient/my-example-patient:
#     name: My Example Patient

#     exampleBoolean: true
#   Patient/bad-example: omit

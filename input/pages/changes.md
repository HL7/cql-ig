This page details changes made in each version of the Using CQL with FHIR Implementation Guide.

### Initial STU Ballot (version 1.0.0-ballot)

This is the first ballot of this implementation guide in this form, but the content has been balloted and published in multiple prior implementation guides, including:

* [Clinical Guidelines](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/cpg/libraries.html)
* [Quality Measures](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/using-cql.html)
* [Canonical Resource Management Infrastructure](http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/crmi/2023Sep/using-cql.html)

The following changes were made as a result of ballot comments received in the September 2023 ballot of the Canonical Resource Management Infrastructure IG. One of those comments was the suggestion to break this CQL-specific content out into its own implementation guide; this IG is the result of that change.

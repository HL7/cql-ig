canonical: 'http://hl7.org/fhir/uv/cql'
introduction: >-
  [Clinical Quality Language (CQL)](http://cql.hl7.org) is a clinically-focused query language that can be used to express logic in a 
  broad range of healthcare use cases, including clinical decision and cognitive support, public health and quality reporting, 
  computable clinical guidelines, research trial eligibility, and many others. This implementation guide provides conformance criteria and
  guidance for using CQL with FHIR across these use cases.
